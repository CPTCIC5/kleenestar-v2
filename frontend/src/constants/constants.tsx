Your “Running Shoes” campaign is performing exceptionally with a conversion rate that’s 5% higher than the previous period. - Meta: Your eco-friendly sportswear videos have seen a 12% increase in engagement rates since last month. However, the conversion rate is 2% below the target. - TikTok: The interactive hashtag challenge launched last week has significantly boosted engagement, with a 25% increase in views. However, the share-to-like ratio suggests that targeting could be optimized to improve conversions. Would you like to explore any of these campaigns in more detail?";
